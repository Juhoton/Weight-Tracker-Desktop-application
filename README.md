<H1>{WIP}</H1>
Has no build, and is still missing key functionality.
Pushed to github to showcase my garbage code.

An application made for tracking weekly weight averages. It automates some of the processes that I do every sunday, like calculating weekly average weight, and using online calculators for some specific body information like body fat. 

Made for a school course, but the project was mostly free to design as wanted. Uses mvp architecture, and has some design patterns, like repository. I wanted to use svelte for the project, so that's why I chose electron as well. Tauri was an option that I was interested in. I had a time limit though, so I didn't have enough time to actually learn rust. Overall learned a lot from all of the used technologies, but was slightly too much to learn them all at the same time.


Made using https://github.com/braebo/sveltekit-electron template.
